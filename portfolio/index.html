					<!--<p>During my education, <span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">I spent three summers at Brookhaven National Laboratory</span>, where I developed tools for controlling 
						beamline microscope components and spearheaded the design and development of a Python tool utilized to process data 
						and produce images.</p>
					<p>I developed a cross-platform push notification application in a small team for a local non-profit rehabilitation 
						clinic, which was designed to reach patients in an effective manner with minimal costs.</p>-->

					<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
					<img src="images/winter-350px.png" alt="Snowy Mountain" />
					<!--<p>One of my current hobbies is the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. It is a game that requires high levels 
						of strategy and thought, resulting in no two matches being the same. There are many formats that can be played 
						at casual and competitive levels, and is a great way to spend time with friends and to make new ones.</p>
					<p>During the winter I love to ski, and have spent a lot of time on various mountains primarily in the North-Eastern US. 
						I have had some opportunities to ski in other regions, and hope to do more in the future.</p>-->
